Yu-7 is taller than the majority of Yus. The response time is slower and the subject is usually very calm in all
scenarios. Glitch anomalies are reported. More on that can be inside the article about Yu-██. The condition of this
Yu seems to be perfect at all times. Tests have been conducted with the intention of wearing her down with no noted success.

Yu-7-H is a Yu-7 subclass. Everything except appearance is the same as Yu-7. Glitch anomalies are reported more often. 
The condition of this Yu is questionable. The subject has a painted on smile and glows significally more than others.
