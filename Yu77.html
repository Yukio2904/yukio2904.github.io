Yu-77 appears to be a "Neko" of asian descent.
As of ██.██.██, Yu-77 does not seem capable of eating.
The subject's mouth seems to be completely absent. 
It is believed the subject is still eating, however.
She has shown a peculiar disgust for breathing.
The subject's body is extremely radioactive, yet somehow fully tested and safe to be around.

Yu-77-B seems a lot more serious unlike the other Yus. Named Yu-77-B after the similarities to Yu-77 and the
surprising and unique appearance of bunny ears instead of feline ones. The body is made out of an element we
cannot gather or identify. It appears to be some kind of metal, yet we have not succeeded in getting a sample
or even scratching it.

			<p class="description">
Named after the similarities to Yu-77 and a classic maid outfit, Yu-77-M is very loyal. It's easy to hurt her and she then
proceeds to display tear-like symbols on her eyes. She has a clear case of heterochromia. The body is a copy of Yu-77's body,
but without any shine to it, enough to make it look like clay, but it has been confirmed metal.
