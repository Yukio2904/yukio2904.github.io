Yu-64 appears to be a "Neko" of asian descent.
Yu-64 is significally smaller than the majority of Yus.
The subject's mouth is made out of 6 face plates opening up whenever 
the subject decides to bite. 
Speculations say there are more of Yu-64's as if they were their own species.
No proof of this has ever been conducted, but just in case they should be referred to as 
Yu-64-[x].
The subject's body is shiny, pink and very fragile.
