Yu-19 is barely a Yu at all. The body is made from a different metal, the Yu is equipped with neurotoxin and it has
"Aperture Science" stickers all over it. It's also capable of understanding advanced chemistry and physics. We're not
sure how it got here in the first place, but we sent it back to Aperture Laboratories the day we found her.
